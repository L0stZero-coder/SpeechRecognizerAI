A lightweight C# console application that captures live voice chat, converts speech to text via Azure Cognitive Services, uses an AI model to extract and learn personal details from the transcript, and persistently stores that evolving user profile in a JSON-backed memory.


This solution is composed of three core stages—Audio Capture, AI Processing, and Memory Management—wrapped in a simple C# console application. Here’s how it all fits together, step by step:

-> Audio Capture & Speech‐to‐Text

The app uses Azure’s Cognitive Services Speech SDK to open the default microphone and listen continuously.

As soon as the user speaks, the SDK streams audio to Azure’s cloud endpoint, which returns a transcription in real time.

This component handles ambient noise and uses Microsoft’s neural-network models under the hood to maximize accuracy.

-> AI Understanding & Information Extraction

Each transcribed utterance is packaged into a prompt and sent to an LLM (for example, OpenAI’s GPT model via a .NET client library).

The prompt instructs the model to parse the text and output a structured JSON object with any detected personal attributes:

Identity details (name, age)

Preferences (favorite topics, foods, habits)

Emotional tone (current mood, sentiment)

Ongoing interests (hobbies, projects)

The app parses the returned JSON into native C# data structures, ready for merging into memory.

-> Memory Management & Learning Loop

A simple JSON file on disk serves as persistent “memory.” Internally, it’s a dictionary keyed by user identifier, each value itself a dictionary of attribute→value mappings.

On every new transcript, the app “merges” newly extracted fields into the existing profile: new facts overwrite or augment older ones.

Over time, the memory file grows into a cumulative, evolving profile for each speaker—enabling increasingly personalized interactions or follow-ups.

-> Putting It All Together

The console UI is bare-bones: it prints each recognized phrase, shows the AI’s extracted output, and confirms the updated memory state.

Behind the scenes, error handlers catch failed transcriptions or invalid AI responses, retry where appropriate, and safeguard against data corruption.

-> Extensibility & Production Hardening

User Identification: Swap the hard-coded “default_user” for real chat participant IDs from your voice-chat platform.

Storage Backend: Replace the JSON file with a robust datastore (SQL, NoSQL) for scalability and transaction safety.

Prompt Engineering: Tweak the AI prompt to capture exactly the traits you care about—e.g. “Detect medical conditions,” “Track technical skills,” etc.

Error Handling: Add retry logic, timeouts, and graceful fallbacks if either Azure or the AI service is unavailable.

Security: Encrypt the memory file or database at rest; use HTTPS/TLS for all API calls; rotate keys regularly.

-> Warning & Compliance
This application collects, processes, and stores potentially sensitive personal information derived from users’ voices. Before deploying:

Obtain Explicit Consent: Clearly inform participants that their speech will be recorded, analyzed by AI, and persisted.

Data Minimization: Only extract and store attributes you genuinely need.

Encryption & Access Control: Encrypt data at rest and in transit; limit database/file access to authorized processes.

Legal Compliance: Verify adherence to GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, or other regional privacy regulations—as applicable for your users’ locations.

Retention Policy: Define how long you’ll keep user profiles, and implement secure deletion procedures once data is no longer needed.

By combining real-time transcription, AI-powered understanding, and a simple—but extensible—memory system, this application can adapt its behavior based on everything it “learns” about each speaker, while still giving you full control over privacy and security.
